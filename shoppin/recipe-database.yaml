twice baked potatoes:
  description: |
    Classic American side-dish, steakhouse style.
    
  directions: |
    Preheat the oven to 400°F.
    
    Wash and dry the potatoes well, pierce each potato once to prevent bursting. Place the potatoes on a parchment lined baking sheet.
    Drizzle with olive oil then brush the oil over each potato until fully coated, and season with a pinch of salt.
    
    Bake in the preheated oven for 60-90 minutes, or until the potatoes can be pierced easily with a fork. Total baking time will depend on the size of your potatoes.
    
    Optionally, while the potatoes are baking, cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until brown and crispy. Remove the cooked bacon from the skillet and allow it to drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Once cool enough to handle, rough chop the bacon into smaller pieces.
    
    Allow the potatoes to cool slightly after baking. When cool enough to handle, cut at an angle to remove the top third of each potato. Carefully scoop out the potato flesh, leaving a thin rim of potato (about ¼ inch rim) around the edges to help the skin hold its shape.
    
    Place the scooped out potato flesh in a large bowl and add the butter, sour cream, milk, salt, and pepper. Use a potato masher or hand mixer to blend the potatoes until light and fluffy. Add the chopped bacon, if using, and half of the sliced green onions and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese to the mashed potatoes, then fold to combine.
    
    Fill the potato skins with about 1/3 cup of the potato mixture, then sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese over the top of each potato.
    
    Bake the potatoes in the oven a second time, just until heated through and the cheddar cheese is melted on top, about 20 minutes.
    
    Top with the remaining green onions and enjoy!

    Tips for the Best Homemade Baked Mac and Cheese
    Use block cheese and shred, do not buy the pre-shredded cheese. The pre-shredded cheese is great for so many things but not macaroni and cheese. It’s coated and won’t melt properly. You need to shred it yourself for the best result.
    Cook your pasta to slightly less than al dente, about one minute shy is perfect. The reason is that this is baked mac and cheese so the pasta will continue to cook in the homemade cheese sauce in the oven. You don’t want soggy macaroni.
    I used elbow pasta but really, any tubular past will work.
    This mac and cheese recipe starts with a roux. The roux is super important to getting the creamiest cheese sauce of your life. 
    The roux (equal parts butter and flour) is whisked together until bubbly and golden.
    Whisk in cold milk – not warm – to prevent the flour from clumping.
    Cook the roux until  you see bubbles on the surface and then continue cooking for an additional 2 minutes before adding the cheese.

    1 tablespoon tomato paste
    1 teaspoon hot sauce
    1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
    
    Lasagna Noodles/ Cheese Topping
    ▢12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage
    ▢2.5 cups mozzarella cheese
    
    
    Equipment
    1 9 x 13-inch casserole dish
    
    Instructions
    Prep Work
    Combine the cheese filling ingredients (ricotta, egg, 2 cups of the shredded mozzarella, parmesan, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper) in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.
    
    Make the Meat Sauce
    Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)
    Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.
    Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.
    
    Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles
    Preheat oven to 375°.
    Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.
    Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.
    
    Assemble
    Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.
    Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.
    Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.
    Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.
    Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.
    Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.
    
    Bake
    Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.
    Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set. 
     
    Pro Tips:
    Flavor Enhancers: The hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce are flavor enhancers and can’t be tasted outright. The hot sauce won’t make it hot/spicy. I use Frank's Hot Sauce.
    
    Cheese: Shred and grate the cheese from a block, avoid using packaged shredded/grated cheese for this recipe. Low moisture, whole milk mozzarella cheese melts the best.
    Lasagna Noodles: No-boil lasagna noodles or fresh lasagna noodles can also be used for this recipe, neither of which need to be cooked first. Fresh lasagna noodles can be found in the deli section of the grocery store.
    Casserole Dish: If your lasagna is very close to the top of your casserole dish, place a baking sheet underneath the casserole dish to catch any splatters of sauce, as it gets hot and bubbly toward the end. A Deep Casserole Dish is helpful.
    
    Storage:
    Store in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Leftovers do freeze well. 
    
    Reheating Leftovers:
    To reheat leftover lasagna, place it in a lightly greased, covered casserole dish. Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes.
