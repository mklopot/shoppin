twice baked potatoes:
  description: |
    Classic American side-dish, steakhouse style.
  directions: |
    Preheat the oven to 400°F.
    
    Wash and dry the potatoes well, pierce each potato once to prevent bursting. Place the potatoes on a parchment lined baking sheet.
    Drizzle with olive oil then brush the oil over each potato until fully coated, and season with a pinch of salt.
    
    Bake in the preheated oven for 60-90 minutes, or until the potatoes can be pierced easily with a fork. Total baking time will depend on the size of your potatoes.
    
    Optionally, while the potatoes are baking, cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until brown and crispy. Remove the cooked bacon from the skillet and allow it to drain on a paper-towel lined plate. Once cool enough to handle, rough chop the bacon into smaller pieces.
    
    Allow the potatoes to cool slightly after baking. When cool enough to handle, cut at an angle to remove the top third of each potato. Carefully scoop out the potato flesh, leaving a thin rim of potato (about ¼ inch rim) around the edges to help the skin hold its shape.
    
    Place the scooped out potato flesh in a large bowl and add the butter, sour cream, milk, salt, and pepper. Use a potato masher or hand mixer to blend the potatoes until light and fluffy. Add the chopped bacon, if using, and half of the sliced green onions and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese to the mashed potatoes, then fold to combine.
    
    Fill the potato skins with about 1/3 cup of the potato mixture, then sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese over the top of each potato.
    
    Bake the potatoes in the oven a second time, just until heated through and the cheddar cheese is melted on top, about 20 minutes.
    
    Top with the remaining green onions and enjoy!

    Tips for the Best Homemade Baked Mac and Cheese
    Use block cheese and shred, do not buy the pre-shredded cheese. The pre-shredded cheese is great for so many things but not macaroni and cheese. It’s coated and won’t melt properly. You need to shred it yourself for the best result.
    Cook your pasta to slightly less than al dente, about one minute shy is perfect. The reason is that this is baked mac and cheese so the pasta will continue to cook in the homemade cheese sauce in the oven. You don’t want soggy macaroni.
    I used elbow pasta but really, any tubular past will work.
    This mac and cheese recipe starts with a roux. The roux is super important to getting the creamiest cheese sauce of your life. 
    The roux (equal parts butter and flour) is whisked together until bubbly and golden.
    Whisk in cold milk – not warm – to prevent the flour from clumping.
    Cook the roux until  you see bubbles on the surface and then continue cooking for an additional 2 minutes before adding the cheese.
