twice baked potatoes:
  directions: >
    Preheat the oven to 400°F. Wash and dry the potatoes well, then use a fork to prick each potato several times.
    Place the potatoes on a parchment lined baking sheet. Drizzle the olive oil over the potatoes, then use your hands or a silicone brush to brush the oil over each potato until it is fully coated. Season the potatoes with a pinch of salt.
    Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the potatoes can be pierced easily with a fork. Total baking time will depend on the size of your potatoes.
    Optionally, while the potatoes are baking, cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until brown and crispy. Remove the cooked bacon from the skillet and allow it to drain on a paper-towel lined plate.
    Once cool enough to handle, rough chop the bacon into smaller pieces. nce the potatoes are done baking, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool slightly. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice them in half lengthwise. Carefully scoop out the potato flesh, leaving a thin rim of potato (about ¼ inch rim) around the edges to help the skin hold its shape.
    Place the scooped out potato flesh in a large bowl and add the butter, sour cream, milk, salt, and pepper. Use a potato masher or hand mixer to blend the potatoes until light and fluffy.
    Add the chopped bacon, half of the sliced green onions, and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese to the mashed potatoes, then fold to combine.
    Fill the potato skins with about 1/3 cup of the potato mixture, then sprinkle the remaining cheddar cheese over the top of each potato.
    Bake the potatoes in the oven a second time, just until heated through and the cheddar cheese is melted on top, about 20 minutes. Top with the remaining green onions and enjoy!

mac-and-cheese casserole:
  description: adapted from https://www.momontimeout.com/best-homemade-baked-mac-and-cheese-recipe/
  directions: |
    Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease a large 3 qt or 4 qt baking dish and set aside.Combine shredded cheeses in a large bowl and set aside.
    Cook the pasta one minute shy of al dente according to the package instructions. Remove from heat, drain, and place in a large bowl.

    Drizzle pasta with olive oil and stir to coat pasta. Set aside to cool while preparing cheese sauce.
    Melt butter in a deep saucepan, dutch oven, or stock pot.
    Whisk in flour over medium heat and continue whisking for about 1 minute until bubbly and golden.
    Gradually whisk in the milk and heavy cream until nice and smooth. Continue whisking until you see bubbles on the surface and then continue cooking and whisking for another 2 minutes. Whisk in salt and pepper.
    Add two cups of shredded cheese and whisk until smooth. Add another two cups of shredded cheese and continue whisking until creamy and smooth. Sauce should be nice and thick.
    Stir in the cooled pasta until combined and pasta is fully coated with the cheese sauce.
    Pour half of the mac and cheese into the prepared baking dish. Top with remaining 2 cups of shredded cheese and then the remaining mac and cheese.
    In a small bowl, combine panko crumbs, Parmesan cheese, melted butter and paprika. Sprinkle over the top and bake until bubbly and golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve immediately.

    Tips for the Best Homemade Baked Mac and Cheese
    Use block cheese and shred, do not buy the pre-shredded cheese. The pre-shredded cheese is great for so many things but not macaroni and cheese. It’s coated and won’t melt properly. You need to shred it yourself for the best result.
    Cook your pasta to slightly less than al dente, about one minute shy is perfect. The reason is that this is baked mac and cheese so the pasta will continue to cook in the homemade cheese sauce in the oven. You don’t want soggy macaroni.
    I used elbow pasta but really, any tubular past will work.
    This mac and cheese recipe starts with a roux. The roux is super important to getting the creamiest cheese sauce of your life. 
    The roux (equal parts butter and flour) is whisked together until bubbly and golden.
    Whisk in cold milk – not warm – to prevent the flour from clumping.
    Cook the roux until  you see bubbles on the surface and then continue cooking for an additional 2 minutes before adding the cheese.
